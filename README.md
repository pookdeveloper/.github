Frontend troubleshooter +8yrs in Angular

🧩 I don't just write code - I solve puzzles.

🔧 When Angular components misbehave, I'm the one who brings them back in line. Currently wielding RxJS streams and TypeScript to craft resilient applications that users actually enjoy using.

♟️ My debugging sessions are like chess matches where I'm always thinking three moves ahead.

🔍 Beyond the usual solutions, I dive deep into core mechanics to build maintainable, performant features that stand the test of time.

🌟 After hours, you'll find me contributing to open source and experimenting with emerging frontend patterns. Because in this field, if you're not learning, you're falling behind.

🚀 Let's build something that works. And then make it work better.
